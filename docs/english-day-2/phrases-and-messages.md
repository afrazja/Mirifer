# English Day 2: Natural phrases, Say it in English, Voice messages, Persian-speaker traps (draft)

Status: **draft, for review and owner approval.** Every fact comes from `world.md` (and Day 1);
anything new is listed in "Notes for the editor" at the end. US English. Each module is written in
its built format: the field names below are the ones in its `.ts` file.

| Module | Set | Track | Code | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Natural phrases | A2 (copied from `ride-v2.md`) | Intermediate (A2) | `src/lib/practice/phrases.ts` | `docs/english-shadowing-spec.md` |
| Natural phrases | B1 (new) | Professional (B1+) | the same | the same |
| Say it in English | Intermediate (copied from `ride-v2.md`) | Intermediate | `src/lib/practice/say-in-english.ts` | `docs/english-say-in-english-spec.md` |
| Say it in English | Professional (new) | Professional | the same | the same |
| Voice messages | one set (A2+) | Both | `src/lib/practice/voice-messages.ts` | `docs/english-voice-messages-spec.md` |
| Persian-speaker traps | one set | Intermediate | `src/lib/practice/traps.ts` | `docs/english-traps-spec.md` |

**Daily lesson subsets.** Some sets are longer than their daily-lesson slot; the rest stays as Module
lab practice. Say it in English (Professional): 3 of 4 items. Voice messages (Intermediate): 2 of 4.
Traps (Intermediate): 5 of 8. Each section says which.

**Who "you" are.** In Say it in English (Professional) and Voice messages, the learner is Sara (the
Voice messages intro says so): Tom is "your friend", the backpack is "your" backpack. Sara isn't
named inside the items. (In the Intermediate Say-it set and the traps, "you" is just a passenger, as
in `ride-v2.md`.)

## 1. Natural phrases

Built format (`Phrase`): `sentence` (what Mira says), `shown` (`**bold**` = the chunk, `‿` = a link;
removing the marks gives `sentence`), `chunk`, `situation {en, fa}`, `tip {en, fa}` (English in
`backticks`), `found` (the word check, a regex run on the say-better `normalise()` output: lower
case, contractions spelled out, so "it'll" is "it will" and "don't" is "do not"). The habit each
chunk replaces is a content note, not a code field. Five sentences per set; the voice is Mira's.

### 1a. A2 set (Intermediate): copied from `ride-v2.md` (reviewed)

Order of the ride: **get in → explain where → ask the time → check how to pay → get out.**

| # | `situation` (en / fa) | `shown` (chunk in bold) | Habit it replaces | `tip` (en / fa) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | You get into the taxi. / سوار تاکسی می‌شوی. | **Could you take me to** the Park Hotel, please? | "I want go to Park Hotel." / "Please go Park Hotel." | `Could you` runs together: `ku-ja`. / `Could you` را پیوسته بگو: `d` و `y` به هم می‌چسبند و «ج» می‌شوند، یعنی `ku-ja`. |
| 2 | The driver doesn't know your hotel. / راننده هتلت را بلد نیست. | It's **right across from** Central Station. | "It's in front of the station." (from «روبه‌روی») | `across` starts with a weak "uh": `uh-CROSS-frum`. / `across` با یک «اَ»ی خیلی کوتاه شروع می‌شود و تأکید روی `CROSS` است: `uh-CROSS-frum`. |
| 3 | You want to know how long the ride is. / می‌خواهی بدانی تا آن‌جا چقدر طول می‌کشد. | **How long does it take** to get there? | "How much does it take?" (from «چقدر طول می‌کشه») | `does it` runs together: `duh-zit`. / `does it` را پیوسته بگو: `duh-zit`. |
| 4 | Before you arrive, you check how to pay. / قبل از رسیدن، می‌پرسی کرایه را چطور می‌توانی بدهی. | **Do you take cards**, or is it cash only? | "Do you accept card?" (from «کارت قبول می‌کنید؟») | `Do you` is short and quick: `d'ya`. / `Do you` را کوتاه و سریع بگو: `d'ya`. |
| 5 | You've arrived at the hotel. / به هتل رسیده‌ای. | You can **drop me‿off** here, thanks. | "I get down here." (from «پیاده می‌شم») | `drop me‿off`: link them, `drop-mee-YOFF`. / `drop me off` را پیوسته بگو: بین `me` و `off` یک «ی» کوتاه می‌آید و تأکید روی `OFF` است: `drop-mee-YOFF`. |

`sentence` and `chunk` for each (the plain sentence is `shown` without the marks):

| # | `sentence` | `chunk` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Could you take me to the Park Hotel, please? | could you take me to |
| 2 | It's right across from Central Station. | right across from |
| 3 | How long does it take to get there? | how long does it take |
| 4 | Do you take cards, or is it cash only? | do you take cards |
| 5 | You can drop me off here, thanks. | drop me off |

**Word check** (copied from `ride-v2.md`; only the chunk, never the accent), with the `found` regex
text for it (tested against `normalise()`: each finds its own sentence, ignores the other nine
sentences of both sets, and rejects its habit):

| # | What it listens for (reviewed) | `found` (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | could / can / would you (please) take me to | `/\b(could\|can\|would) you (please )?take (me\|us) to\b/` |
| 2 | across from (with or without "right"); "in front of" doesn't count | `/\bacross from\b/` |
| 3 | how long does / will / would / is / 's it (or the ride) (going to) take; "how much does it take" doesn't count | `/\bhow long('s\| does\| will\| would\| is) (it\|the ride) (usually \|normally \|going to )?take\b/` |
| 4 | do you take (credit / debit) card(s); "accept" doesn't count | `/\bdo you take (credit \|debit )?cards?\b/` |
| 5 | drop me / us off; "drop off me" doesn't count | `/\bdrop (me\|us) off\b/` |

### 1b. B1 set (Professional): new

The same five steps of the ride, one B1 chunk each, so the set still tells one short story. Each
chunk replaces a habit learners have (most come from Persian; #1 and #3 are English
overgeneralisations), and each tip has one sound feature only.

| # | `situation` (en / fa) | `shown` (chunk in bold) | Habit it replaces | `tip` (en / fa) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | You get into a taxi with a heavy suitcase. / با یک چمدانِ سنگین در فرودگاه سوار تاکسی می‌شوی. | **Would you mind helping** me with my suitcase? | "Do you mind to help me…?" (an English overgeneralisation from "want to" / "like to", not from Persian) | In `mind helping`, the `d` almost disappears: `mine-HEL-ping`. / در `mind helping` صدای `d` تقریباً گفته نمی‌شود: `mine-HEL-ping`. |
| 2 | The driver doesn't seem to know your hotel. / راننده انگار هتلت را نمی‌شناسد. | It's pretty new. **Have you heard‿of‿it**? | "Have you heard it?" / "Did you hear its name?" (from «اسمش رو شنیدید؟») | `heard of it` runs together like one word: `HER-duh-vit`. / `heard of it` را پیوسته و مثل یک کلمه بگو: `HER-duh-vit`. |
| 3 | The highway is closed, so you go through downtown. / بزرگراه بسته است و از مرکز شهر می‌روید. | With all this traffic, **how long do you think it'll take**? | "Do you think how long it takes?" (from «فکر می‌کنید چقدر طول می‌کشه؟») / "How long do you think will it take?" (an English overgeneralisation of question order, not from Persian) | `it'll` is quick: `ID-ul`, not `it will`. / `it'll` را سریع بگو: `ID-ul`، نه `it will`. |
| 4 | The driver says to have some cash ready. / راننده می‌گوید بهتر است کمی پول نقد آماده داشته باشی. | I **don't have much cash‿on me**, so I'll pay by card. | "I don't have cash with me." (from «پول نقد همراهم نیست»): fine, but "on me" is the more natural spoken chunk | `cash on me`: link them, `CA-shon-mee`. / `cash on me` را پیوسته بگو: `sh` به `on` می‌چسبد، یعنی `CA-shon-mee`. |
| 5 | You've paid, and you're getting out. / کرایه را داده‌ای و داری پیاده می‌شوی. | Thanks for the ride. **Have a good one!** | "Good luck!" / "Don't be tired!" (from «موفق باشید» / «خسته نباشید») | `one` starts with a `w` sound, not `v`: `GOOD-wun`. / `one` با صدای `w` شروع می‌شود، نه `v`: لب‌هایت را گرد کن و بگو `GOOD-wun`. |

| # | `sentence` | `chunk` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Would you mind helping me with my suitcase? | would you mind helping |
| 2 | It's pretty new. Have you heard of it? | have you heard of it |
| 3 | With all this traffic, how long do you think it'll take? | how long do you think it'll take |
| 4 | I don't have much cash on me, so I'll pay by card. | don't have much cash on me |
| 5 | Thanks for the ride. Have a good one! | have a good one |

**Word check** (only the chunk; tested as above):

| # | What it listens for | `found` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | would / do you mind + an -ing verb ("would you mind helping", "do you mind taking"); "mind to help" doesn't count | `/\b(would\|do) you mind (please )?\w+ing\b/` |
| 2 | heard of / heard about ("have you heard of it", "you might not have heard of it"); "have you heard it" and "did you hear it" don't count | `/\bheard (of\|about)\b/` |
| 3 | how long do you think it / the ride / this / that (will / would / 's going to) take(s); "do you think will it take" and "do you think how long it takes" don't count | `/\bhow long do you think (?:it\|the ride\|this\|that)(?: will\| would\|'s going to\|'s gonna\| is going to\| is gonna)? takes?\b/` |
| 4 | cash / money on me; "with me" is fine English but isn't the chunk, so it doesn't count | `/\b(cash\|money) on me\b/` |
| 5 | have a good / nice / great one / day / night; "good luck" doesn't count | `/\bhave a (good\|nice\|great) (one\|day\|night\|evening\|trip)\b/` |

**Where the B1 chunks are heard:** in the module itself, which plays each sentence before the
learner says it (the ride conversation in `ride-v2.md` stays as reviewed).

## 2. Say it in English

Built format (`SayItem`): `id`, `to {en, fa}`, `fa` (the message in spoken Persian), `points` (2,
each `{en, fa}`), `models` (natural versions; 2 here, each 25 words or fewer, the code's test
limit), `hints` (2, each `{en, fa}`). Plus one `NAMES` string per set (to help speech-to-text).
Four items per set. `fa`, points and hints are shown as plain text (no backticks are rendered there),
so they hold no English except names.

### 2a. Intermediate set: copied from `ride-v2.md` (reviewed)

All four `to`: **To the taxi driver / به رانندهٔ تاکسی.** (The `id`s are new; the rest is copied.)

| # | `id` | `fa` | `points` (en / fa) | `models` | `hints` (en / fa) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `trunk` | می‌شه چمدونم رو بذارید صندوق عقب؟ یه کم سنگینه. | you'd like help putting your suitcase in the trunk / می‌خواهی چمدانت را در صندوق عقب بگذارد · it's a little heavy / چمدانت کمی سنگین است | "Could you put my suitcase in the trunk, please? It's a little heavy." · "Can you help me with my suitcase? It's kind of heavy." | trunk / صندوق عقب · heavy / سنگینه |
| 2 | `museum` | می‌خوام برم موزهٔ شهر. روبه‌روی پارک مرکزیه. | you want to go to the City Museum / می‌خواهی به موزهٔ شهر بروی · it's across from Central Park / موزه روبه‌روی پارک مرکزی است | "Could you take me to the City Museum? It's right across from Central Park." · "The City Museum, please. It's across from Central Park." | take me to / من رو ببرید… · across from / روبه‌روی |
| 3 | `atm` | می‌شه سر راه جلوی یه خودپرداز نگه دارید؟ می‌خوام محض احتیاط یه کم پول نقد بگیرم. | you'd like to stop at an ATM on the way / می‌خواهی سرِ راه جلوی یک خودپرداز نگه دارد · you want some cash, just in case / می‌خواهی محض احتیاط کمی پول نقد بگیری | "Could we stop at an ATM on the way? I'd like some cash, just in case." · "Can you stop at an ATM on the way, please? I want to get some cash, just in case." | on the way / سرِ راه · just in case / محض احتیاط |
| 4 | `receipt` | همین‌جا پیاده می‌شم، ممنون. می‌شه یه رسید هم بدید؟ | you'd like to get out here / می‌خواهی همین‌جا پیاده شوی · you're asking for a receipt / رسید می‌خواهی | "You can drop me off here, thanks. Could I get a receipt?" · "Here's fine, thanks. Can I have a receipt, please?" | drop me off / پیاده می‌شم · a receipt / رسید |

- Traps on purpose: «صندوق عقب» is "trunk" (US), not "back box"; «روبه‌روی» is "across from", not
  "in front of"; #3 is where the learner says a link phrase (`just in case`) themselves.
- `NAMES`: "Park Hotel, Main Street, Central Station, City Museum, Central Park."

### 2b. Professional set: new

Four longer messages to people in Sara's day, in timeline order: paying the taxi, arriving at the
hotel, Tom about dinner, the RideNow driver that evening. Each needs a B1 move: a reason ("because,
so"), a condition ("if"), or a request about something that hasn't happened yet. Item 1 reuses B1
natural phrase #4 (`cash on me`, paying by card) for transfer.

**Daily lesson:** the Professional daily lesson uses 3 items: `pay-tip`, `hotel-bags`, `tom-dinner`.
`ridenow-pickup` (it overlaps Voice message 4) stays as lab practice.

**1. `id`: `pay-tip`**
- `to`: To the taxi driver / به رانندهٔ تاکسی
- `fa`: با کارت حساب می‌کنم، آخه پول نقد زیادی همراهم نیست. ده دلار هم انعام بذارید روش، بشه شصت‌وپنج دلار.
- `points`:
  1. you'll pay by card, because you don't have much cash on you / با کارت حساب می‌کنی، چون پول نقد زیادی همراهت نیست
  2. you want to add a ten-dollar tip, so it comes to sixty-five dollars / می‌خواهی ده دلار انعام اضافه کنی، که روی هم شصت‌وپنج دلار شود
- `models`:
  - "I'll pay by card, if that's OK. I don't have much cash on me. Could you make it sixty-five, with the tip?"
  - "Can I pay by card? I don't have much cash on me. Could you add a ten-dollar tip? That makes it sixty-five."
- `hints`: cash on me / پول نقد همراهم · make it sixty-five / بشه شصت‌وپنج
- Main trap: «همراهم نیست» → "I don't have cash with me" is fine, but "on me" is the more natural spoken chunk; «انعام بذارید روش» → "put the tip on it" (natural: "make it sixty-five", "add a tip").
- Facts: the fare is $55 (world); $10 is about 18%, inside the usual 15–20%.

**2. `id`: `hotel-bags`**
- `to`: To the hotel front desk / به پذیرش هتل
- `fa`: اتاقم تا ساعت سه آماده نمی‌شه، درسته؟ پس چمدونم رو این‌جا می‌ذارم و بعداً برمی‌گردم. راستی، فردا صبح شرکت هواپیمایی کوله‌پشتیم رو میاره این‌جا؛ اگه نبودم، می‌شه تحویلش بگیرید؟
- `points`:
  1. you want to leave your suitcase here until your room is ready / می‌خواهی تا آماده شدن اتاق، چمدانت را همین‌جا بگذاری
  2. the airline is bringing your backpack tomorrow morning, and you'd like them to take it if you're out / شرکت هواپیمایی فردا صبح کوله‌پشتی‌ات را می‌آورد و می‌خواهی اگر نبودی، آن را تحویل بگیرند
- `models`:
  - "Can I leave my suitcase here until three? Also, the airline's bringing my backpack tomorrow morning. Could you keep it for me if I'm out?"
  - "I'll leave my suitcase with you, then. The airline's dropping off my backpack tomorrow morning. Could you take it if I'm out?"
- `hints`: leave my suitcase with you / چمدونم رو این‌جا می‌ذارم · if I'm out / اگه نبودم
- Main trap: «تحویلش بگیرید» → "receive it" (stiff; natural: "take it", "keep it for me"); «اگه نبودم» → "if I wasn't" (natural: "if I'm out").
- Facts: check-in from 3 p.m., bags can be left at the desk (world); the backpack comes to the hotel tomorrow morning (Day 1).

**3. `id`: `tom-dinner`**
- `to`: To Tom, your friend in Riverton / به تام، دوستت در ریورتون
- `fa`: ساعت هفت عالیه! ماشینت که هنوز خرابه، پس نگران من نباش؛ خودم یه جوری میام رستوران. آدرس رو برام می‌فرستی؟
- `points`:
  1. he doesn't need to worry: you'll get to the restaurant on your own / لازم نیست نگران باشد؛ خودت به رستوران می‌روی
  2. you're asking him to send you the address / از او می‌خواهی آدرس را برایت بفرستد
- `models`:
  - "Seven's perfect! Your car's still broken, right? So don't worry about me. I'll get there on my own. Can you send me the address?"
  - "Seven works for me. Since your car's still in the shop, I'll find my own way there. Could you text me the address?"
- `hints`: on my own / خودم · text me the address / آدرس رو برام بفرست
- Main trap: «خودم میام» → "I come myself" (natural: "I'll get there on my own").
- Facts: dinner at 7; Tom's car is still broken tonight (world). Sara asking for the address is new (see notes); the restaurant isn't named.

**4. `id`: `ridenow-pickup`**
- `to`: To your RideNow driver / به رانندهٔ تاکسی اینترنتی
- `fa`: سلام، من جلوی در اصلی هتل منتظرم. اگه این‌جا نمی‌تونید نگه دارید، اشکالی نداره؛ می‌تونم بیام اون طرف خیابون، جلوی ایستگاه.
- `points`:
  1. you're waiting at the hotel's main entrance / جلوی در اصلی هتل منتظر هستی
  2. if he can't stop there, you can cross the street to the station / اگر نتواند آن‌جا نگه دارد، می‌توانی به آن طرف خیابان، جلوی ایستگاه بروی
- `models`:
  - "Hi, I'm waiting at the main entrance of the hotel. If you can't stop here, no problem. I can cross the street to the station."
  - "Hi, I'm by the hotel's front door. If it's hard to pull over here, I can meet you across the street, at the station."
- `hints`: the main entrance / در اصلی · pull over / نگه دارید
- Main trap: «نگه دارید» → "keep here" / "hold here" (natural: "stop", "pull over"); «اون طرف خیابون» → "the other side of the street" is fine, "across the street" is shorter.
- Facts: the hotel is right across from Central Station; traffic near the station is bad today; Sara takes a RideNow to dinner, and Carlos waits across from the hotel (world).

- `NAMES`: "Park Hotel, Central Station, Tom, Riverton, RideNow."

---

## 3. Voice messages (both tracks, A2+)

Built format (`VoiceMessage`): `id`, `from {name, who {en, fa}, voice}`, `sentences` (one audio
request each; 120 characters or fewer, the code's test limit), `asks` (each `{ask {en, fa}, missed
{en, fa}}`), `model` (a natural reply, 40 words or fewer). Four messages; like Day 1, three have 2
asks and the last has 1. The natural reply is read by Mira (Ava, `b`). Voices: `a` Andrew, `c` Brian.
Timeline order: on the plane → after landing, before the taxi → in the taxi → that evening.

**Daily lesson:** the Intermediate daily lesson uses 2 messages, Tom (`tom`) and Daniel (`hotel`).
The other two (`baggage`, `ridenow`) are lab practice.

**Intro** (the built intro names Day 1's senders, so Day 2 needs its own; it's a constant in
`VoiceMessages.svelte`, not in the `.ts` file):
- en: "Today, you're Sara. You'll get four voice messages: from your friend Tom, the
  airline, the Park Hotel and your RideNow driver. Listen, then reply with a voice message. Make sure
  you answer their questions."
- fa: امروز جای سارا هستی. چهار پیام صوتی می‌گیری: از دوستت تام، شرکت هواپیمایی، هتل پارک و رانندهٔ تاکسی اینترنتی‌ات. گوش بده و با یک پیام صوتی جواب بده. حواست باشد به سؤال‌هایشان جواب بدهی.

## 4. Persian-speaker traps (Intermediate)

Built format (`Trap`): `id`, `kind {en, fa}`, `words` (the sentence with the mistake, word by word),
`wrong` (index of the word to tap), optional `alsoOk` (`{index, sentence}`), `right`, `why {en, fa}`,
`accept` and `reject` (regex text, run on the traps `normalise()`: lower case, plain quotes, no
punctuation; contractions are **not** spelled out here), optional `alsoGood {patterns, word}`. Eight
traps, none of Day 1's (he/she, agree, say/tell, age, since/for, than, afraid of, bored). Following
the built ones and the code's test, `why.fa` has no backticks: English goes in «», and the screen
keeps its direction.

All eight were run through the code's checks: `right` passes, the sentence with the mistake fails,
and the extra forms listed pass.

**Daily lesson:** the Intermediate daily lesson uses 5 of the 8. Left out: #1 `been-waiting` (B1
grammar) and #4 `how-long` (the same sentence as Natural phrases A2 #3); they stay as lab practice.
That leaves six for five places, so one more must move to the lab (see notes).

**1. `id`: `been-waiting`** · `kind`: I've been waiting / I’ve been waiting
- `words`: `["I'm", "waiting", "here", "for", "twenty", "minutes.", "Where's", "the", "bus?"]` · `wrong`: 0 (`I'm`)
- `right`: I've been waiting here for twenty minutes. Where's the bus?
- `why` en: For something that started earlier and is still going on, say “I’ve been waiting”, not “I’m waiting”.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «بیست دقیقه است که منتظرم». در انگلیسی برای کاری که قبلاً شروع شده و هنوز ادامه دارد، «I’ve been waiting» می‌گوییم، نه «I’m waiting».
- `accept`: `/\b(?:i've|i have|ive) been waiting\b/`
- `reject`: `/\b(?:i'm|i am|im) waiting\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\b(?:i've|i have|ive) waited\b/`, `/\b(?:i've|i have|ive) been here\b/` · word "been waiting"
- From this trip: Bus 7 comes every 30 minutes (world).

**2. `id`: `to-not-until`** · `kind`: to (a place) / to (مقصد)
- `words`: `["How", "much", "is", "it", "until", "the", "Park", "Hotel?"]` · `wrong`: 4 (`until`)
- `right`: How much is it to the Park Hotel?
- `why` en: “Until” is for time (until three). For the place you’re going to, use “to”.
- `why` fa: «تا» در فارسی هم برای زمان است هم برای مکان. در انگلیسی «until» فقط برای زمان است (until three). برای مقصد «to» می‌گوییم: «to the Park Hotel».
- `accept`: `/\bto (?:the )?park hotel\b/`
- `reject`: `/\b(?:until|till|til) (?:the )?park hotel\b/`
- Also passes: "How much to the Park Hotel?"

**3. `id`: `near-of`** · `kind`: near (no “of”) / near (بدون of)
- `words`: `["Is", "the", "hotel", "near", "of", "Central", "Station?"]` · `wrong`: 4 (`of`)
- `right`: Is the hotel near Central Station?
- `why` en: “Near” doesn’t need “of”. Say “near the station”.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «نزدیکِ ایستگاه» و همین کسره باعث می‌شود «of» اضافه کنیم. ولی «near» خودش کافی است: «near the station».
- `accept`: `/\bnear (?:the )?central station\b/`
- `reject`: `/\bnear of\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\b(?:close to|next to|across from) (?:the )?central station\b/` · word "near"

**4. `id`: `how-long`** · `kind`: how long (time) / how long (زمان)
- `words`: `["How", "much", "does", "it", "take", "to", "get", "there?"]` · `wrong`: 1 (`much`)
- `right`: How long does it take to get there?
- `why` en: “How much” asks about money or amounts. For time, ask “How long”.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «چقدر طول می‌کشد»، ولی «how much» در انگلیسی برای پول و مقدار است. برای زمان «how long» می‌گوییم.
- `accept`: `/\bhow long(?:'s| does| will| would| is| do you think)\b/`
- `reject`: `/\bhow much (?:does|will|would|is) it (?:going to )?take\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\bhow much time\b/` · word "long"
- Also passes: "How long will it take?", "How long's it going to take?"

**5. `id`: `bad-traffic`** · `kind`: bad traffic / bad traffic
- `words`: `["The", "traffic", "is", "very", "much", "today."]` · `wrong`: 4 (`much`)
- `right`: The traffic is very bad today.
- `why` en: In English, traffic is “bad” or “heavy”, not “much”.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «ترافیک خیلی زیاد است»، ولی در انگلیسی ترافیک «bad» یا «heavy» است، نه «much». مثل «ترافیک سنگین» در فارسی، «heavy traffic» هم درست است.
- `accept`: `/\btraffic(?: is|'s) (?:really |very |so |pretty )?(?:bad|heavy|terrible|awful)\b/`
- `reject`: `/\btraffic(?: is|'s) (?:very |so |too )?much\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\b(?:a lot of|lots of|so much|too much) traffic\b/` · word "bad"
- From this trip: the highway is closed, and the traffic near the station is bad (world).

**6. `id`: `on-the-bus`** · `kind`: on the bus / on the bus
- `words`: `["I'm", "in", "the", "bus", "now."]` · `wrong`: 1 (`in`)
- `right`: I'm on the bus now.
- `why` en: You’re “on” a bus or a train, but “in” a taxi or a car.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «تو اتوبوسم». در انگلیسی برای اتوبوس و قطار «on» می‌گوییم (on the bus) و برای تاکسی و ماشین «in» (in a taxi).
- `accept`: `/\bon (?:the |a )?(?:bus|train)\b/`
- `reject`: `/\bin (?:the |a )?(?:bus|train)\b/`
- Also passes: "I'm on a train now." ("I'm in a taxi" is neither accepted nor rejected.)
- From this trip: Bus 7 and the Airport Express (world).

**7. `id`: `get-out`** · `kind`: get out (of a car) / get out (از ماشین)
- `words`: `["I'll", "get", "down", "here,", "thanks."]` · `wrong`: 2 (`down`)
- `right`: I'll get out here, thanks.
- `why` en: You “get out of” a car or a taxi, and “get off” a bus or a train. “Get down” means to go lower, like off a chair.
- `why` fa: در فارسی از ماشین و اتوبوس هر دو «پیاده می‌شویم». در انگلیسی از ماشین و تاکسی «get out» می‌گوییم و از اتوبوس و قطار «get off». «get down» یعنی پایین آمدن، مثلاً از صندلی.
- `accept`: `/\bget out\b/`
- `reject`: `/\bget (?:down|off)\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\bdrop (?:me|us) off\b/`, `/\bhere(?:'s| is) fine\b/` · word "out"

**8. `id`: `help-with`** · `kind`: help with / help with
- `words`: `["Can", "you", "help", "me", "for", "my", "suitcase?"]` · `wrong`: 4 (`for`)
- `right`: Can you help me with my suitcase?
- `why` en: You help someone “with” something, not “for” it.
- `why` fa: در فارسی می‌گوییم «برای بردن چمدانم کمکم می‌کنید؟» و «برای» را «for» ترجمه می‌کنیم. ولی در انگلیسی بعد از «help me» کلمهٔ «with» می‌آید، نه «for».
- `accept`: `/\bhelp me with\b/`
- `reject`: `/\bhelp me for\b/`
- `alsoGood`: patterns `/\bhelp me (?:carry|take|lift|get)\b/`, `/\bgive me a hand\b/` · word "with"
- From this trip: Sara's big gray suitcase is heavy (world).

**Candidates left out**
- "I want go to…": the mistake is a missing word ("to"). The built module only taps a wrong word; the
  spec puts missing words in a later "insert a word" mode.
- "The bus is more cheap": Persian makes comparatives with «‑تر», like English "-er", so this isn't a
  mistake that comes from Persian. (Day 1 also has a comparative trap, "taller from".)
- "in front of" for "across from": three words, so there's no single word to tap, and "The hotel is in
  front of the station" isn't wrong without the story. It's taught in Natural phrases A2 #2 instead.
- "Do you accept card?": "accept" is fine English, so the only mistake is the missing "s". It's
  taught in Natural phrases A2 #4 instead.
- "Can I pay with card?": everyday US speech, so it isn't a mistake (replaced by `on-the-bus`).

## Notes for the editor

Only what's still open.

### (a) New facts to add to `world.md`

1. **Carlos's message:** a white car; the traffic by the station stops him from reaching the hotel
   door, so he waits across the street in front of Central Station and Sara crosses. (`world.md`
   says only that he waits across from the hotel.)
2. **Daniel's message** also asks when Sara will get to the hotel and if she needs help with her bags.
3. **Sara pays the $55 fare plus the $10 tip by card ($65 in all).**
4. **Sara asks Tom for the restaurant's address** and gets there on her own (the restaurant isn't
   named).
5. **The learner is Sara** in Say it in English (Professional) and Voice messages. `world.md` still
   describes "you" only as a learner on their own trip, and still names the tracks Starter /
   Confident (now Intermediate / Professional).

### (b) Open questions

1. **Traps daily lesson: one more to drop.** Leaving out #1 and #4 leaves six traps for five places.
   A candidate is #7 `get-out`, whose `alsoGood` ("drop me off") is Natural phrases A2 #5 again.
2. **B1 chunk choices.** "Have you heard of it?" and "Have a good one!" replace the owner's "right
   across from" and "drop me off", which are already A2 chunks. Either of the owner's could go back
   in place of #2 or #5.
3. **Spare Say-it item.** The lost-phone item is left out of the Professional set so it doesn't give
   away the role-play's surprise. A spare, if the surprise changes:
   - `id` `lost-phone` · `to` To Riverton Taxi / به تاکسی ریورتون
   - `fa`: سلام، امروز با یکی از تاکسی‌هاتون از فرودگاه اومدم هتل پارک و گوشیم رو تو ماشین جا گذاشتم. می‌شه از راننده بپرسید؟
   - `points`: you left your phone in one of their taxis (airport → Park Hotel) / گوشی‌ات را در یکی از تاکسی‌هایشان جا گذاشته‌ای (از فرودگاه تا هتل پارک) · you're asking them to check with the driver / از آن‌ها می‌خواهی از راننده بپرسند
   - `models`: "Hi, I left my phone in one of your taxis today, from the airport to the Park Hotel. Could you check with the driver?" · "I think I left my phone in one of your taxis. It took me from the airport to the Park Hotel. Can you check?"
   - `hints`: I left my phone / گوشیم رو جا گذاشتم · check with the driver / از راننده بپرسید
4. **Code and prompts outside the content arrays** (not edited):
   - the Voice messages intro is a constant in `VoiceMessages.svelte`; the Day 2 version is above;
   - `src/lib/server/voice-messages-ai.ts` names "Mr Brown and the clinic" in its tone rule, which
     needs to become per-day (for example "To the hotel, the airline and a driver: polite but
     simple");
   - `say-in-english.ts` and its AI prompt say A2. The Professional models are B1, so the "better"
     version may need a B1 level for that set;
   - the daily-lesson subsets (Say it 3 of 4, Voice messages 2 of 4, traps 5 of 8) need a way to
     pick items per track; today each module runs its whole array.
5. **Speech-to-text risk for the traps** (as the spec says): it may quietly fix "near of", "in the
   bus" or "how much does it take". Record each wrong sentence with a Persian accent before these
   ship.
6. **Only A2 #3's `found` regex has been reviewed**; the other A2 regexes are mine (`ride-v2.md` gives
   the word check only in prose).
